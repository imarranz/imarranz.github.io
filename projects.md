## Personal Projects

### &#9822; PYGENMET

I have developed this package of Genetic Algorithms to subtype patients with NASH, although it is a tool that can be used for all types of diseases.

### &#9822; Data Science Workflow Management

A very personal project. I like to be organized but especially in Data Science projects. Often, these types of projects can take a long time and for that reason it is very important to control all the analyzes and results. Developing a project efficiently forces us to have the data, the notebooks and the results well organized. In this project I try to generate a general workflow of a Data Science project.

### &#9822; mcm

The `mcm` function is a functional tool for analyzed different metrics from a confusion matrix. Can be very useful to analyze the performance of a binary classification model.

### &#9822; Miscellaneous Python Functions

This is a :gift: _mystery box_ :gift: where I am putting different functions that are useful to me on a day-to-day. What can you find here? Who knows! but it can help you or inspire you.
