### &#9822; PYGENMET

I have developed this package of genetic algorithms to subtype patients with NASH, although it is a tool that can be used for all types of diseases.

### &#9822; Data Science Workflow Management

A very personal project. I like to be organized but especially in Data Science projects. Developing a project efficiently forces us to have the data, the notebooks and the results well organized. In this project I try to generate an outline of a Data Science project.

The `mcm` function is a functional tool for analyzed different metrics from a confusion matrix. Can be very useful to analyze the performance of a binary classification model.
