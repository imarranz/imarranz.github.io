## Welcome to my personal page

Hi :wave:, I'm Ibon

I got my BSc. in Mathematics from the University of the Basque Country (EHU/UPV) and performed a MSc. in Current Applied Statistics Techniques and a MSc. in Mathematical Modeling Research, Statistical Analysis and Computing Sciences. 

In 2004, I joined the Basque Country Health Service (The Department of Health of the Basque Country Government and Osakidetza) as a data analyst and my work was mainly focused on the epidemiological report of renal patients. 

When I joined OWL Metabolomics in 2010, first I worked as a researcher in the Metabolomics Department and in 2017, I became the head of the Data Science Department, being responsible for prediction and statistical computation management since then. This highly experienced team supports metabolomics services, laboratory processes, data handling, R&D projects and technology transfer processes.

### Personal Projects

I am currently writing my thesis. An important part of this thesis develops genetic algorithms to classify patients based on the lipid profile (obtained by LC-MS).

I am also a Data Science enthusiast and I have several projects about that.
