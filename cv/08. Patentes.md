EXAMPLES
How should you List Pending Patents on your Resume?

Even for this category, again, there is no standard format. A style, modeled on the above CMOS, can be used to list pending patents:

[Last name, first name of the inventor.] [The year the patent was filed.] [The title of the invention.] [Country Patent Application number,] filed [Month Date, Year.] Patent Pending.

Example:

Doe, J. 2009. Method to enhance the performance of multimedia-rich applications on computer systems with single-core CPUs. U.S. Patent Application 20000000000, filed January 2009. Patent Pending.

NOTE: The above example is used for illustrative purpose only.

Conclusion: Whether youâ€™ve granted or pending patents, list them on your resume, with a format like the Chicago Manual of Style, to bring your talent to the fore.
