  Abstract                 = {Cancer is one of the most devastating human diseases that causes a vast number of mortalities worldwide each year. Cancer research is one of the largest fields in the life sciences and despite many astounding breakthroughs and contributions over the past few decades, there is still a considerable amount to unveil on the function of cancer. It is well known that cancer metabolism differs from that of normal tissue and an important hypothesis published in the 1950s by Otto Warburg proposed that cancer cells rely on anaerobic metabolism as the source for energy, even under physiological oxygen levels. Following this, cancer central carbon metabolism has been researched extensively and beyond respiration, cancer has been found to involve a wide range of metabolic processes, and many more are still to be unveiled. Studying cancer through metabolomics could reveal new biomarkers for cancer that could be useful for its future prognosis, diagnosis and therapy. Metabolomics is becoming an increasingly popular tool in the life sciences since it is a relatively fast and accurate technique that can be applied with either a particular focus or in a global manner to reveal new knowledge about biological systems. There have been many examples of its application to reveal potential biomarkers in different cancers that have employed a range of different analytical platforms. In this review, approaches in metabolomics that have been employed in cancer biomarker discovery are discussed and some of the most noteworthy research in the field is highlighted.},

  Abstract                 = {A great deal of recent methodological research has focused on two modern missing data analysis methods: maximum likelihood and multiple imputation. These approaches are advantageous to traditional techniques (e.g. deletion and mean imputation techniques) because they require less stringent assumptions and mitigate the pitfalls of traditional techniques. This article explains the theoretical underpinnings of missing data analyses, gives an overview of traditional missing data techniques, and provides accessible descriptions of maximum likelihood and multiple imputation. In particular, this article focuses on maximum likelihood estimation and presents two analysis examples from the Longitudinal Study of American Youth data. One of these examples includes a description of the use of auxiliary variables. Finally, the paper illustrates ways that researchers can use intentional, or planned, missing data to enhance their research designs.},

  Abstract                 = {Our understanding of the mechanisms by which nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progresses from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis (NASH) is still very limited. Despite the growing number of studies linking the disease with altered serum metabolite levels, an obstacle to the development of metabolome-based NAFLD predictors has been the lack of large cohort data from biopsy-proven patients matched for key metabolic features such as obesity. We studied 467 biopsied individuals with normal liver histology (n=90) or diagnosed with NAFLD (steatosis, n=246; NASH, n=131), randomly divided into estimation (80\% of all patients) and validation (20\% of all patients) groups. Qualitative determinations of 540 serum metabolite variables were performed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The metabolic profile was dependent on patient body-mass index (BMI), suggesting that the NAFLD pathogenesis mechanism may be quite different depending on an individual's level of obesity. A BMI-stratified multivariate model based on the NAFLD serum metabolic profile was used to separate patients with and without NASH. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.87 in the estimation and 0.85 in the validation group. The cutoff (0.54) corresponding to maximum average diagnostic accuracy (0.82) predicted NASH with a sensitivity of 0.71 and a specificity of 0.92 (negative/positive predictive values=0.82/0.84). The present data, indicating that a BMI-dependent serum metabolic profile may be able to reliably distinguish NASH from steatosis patients, have significant implications for the development of NASH biomarkers and potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease in most western countries. Current NAFLD diagnosis methods (e.g., liver biopsy analysis or imaging techniques) are poorly suited as tests for such a prevalent condition, from both a clinical and financial point of view. The present work aims to demonstrate the potential utility of serum metabolic profiling in defining phenotypic biomarkers that could be useful in NAFLD management. A parallel animal model/human NAFLD exploratory metabolomics approach was employed, using ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to analyze 42 serum samples collected from nondiabetic, morbidly obese, biopsy-proven NAFLD patients, and 17 animals belonging to the glycine N-methyltransferase knockout (GNMT-KO) NAFLD mouse model. Multivariate statistical analysis of the data revealed a series of common biomarkers that were significantly altered in the NAFLD (GNMT-KO) subjects in comparison to their normal liver counterparts (WT). Many of the compounds observed could be associated with biochemical perturbations associated with liver dysfunction (e.g., reduced Creatine) and inflammation (e.g., eicosanoid signaling). This differential metabolic phenotyping approach may have a future role as a supplement for clinical decision making in NAFLD and in the adaption to more individualized treatment protocols.},

  Abstract                 = {Inflammaging is characterized by the upregulation of the inflammatory response that occurs with advancing age; its roots are strongly embedded in evolutionary theory.Inflammaging is believed to be a consequence of a remodelling of the innate and acquired immune system, resulting in chronic inflammatory cytokine production.Complex interrelated genetic, environmental and age-related factors determine an individual's vulnerability or resilience to inflammaging. These factors include polymorphisms to the promoter regions of cytokines, cytokine receptors and antagonists, age-related decreases in autophagy and increased adiposity. Anti-inflammaging describes the upregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in response to inflammaging, leading to higher levels of cortisol, which in turn may be detrimental, contributing to less successful ageing and frailty. This may be countered by the adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone, which itself declines with age, leaving certain individuals more vulnerable. Inflammaging and anti-inflammaging have both been linked with a number of age-related outcomes, including chronic morbidity, functional decline and mortality. This important area of research offers unique insights into the ageing process and the potential for screening and targeted interventions.},

  Abstract                 = {Extracting relevant biological information from large data sets is a major challenge in functional genomics research. Different aspects of the data hamper their biological interpretation. For instance, 5000-fold differences in concentration for different metabolites are present in a metabolomics data set, while these differences are not proportional to the biological relevance of these metabolites. However, data analysis methods are not able to make this distinction. Data pretreatment methods can correct for aspects that hinder the biological interpretation of metabolomics data sets by emphasizing the biological information in the data set and thus improving their biological interpretability.Different data pretreatment methods, i.e. centering, autoscaling, pareto scaling, range scaling, vast scaling, log transformation, and power transformation, were tested on a real-life metabolomics data set. They were found to greatly affect the outcome of the data analysis and thus the rank of the, from a biological point of view, most important metabolites. Furthermore, the stability of the rank, the influence of technical errors on data analysis, and the preference of data analysis methods for selecting highly abundant metabolites were affected by the data pretreatment method used prior to data analysis.Different pretreatment methods emphasize different aspects of the data and each pretreatment method has its own merits and drawbacks. The choice for a pretreatment method depends on the biological question to be answered, the properties of the data set and the data analysis method selected. For the explorative analysis of the validation data set used in this study, autoscaling and range scaling performed better than the other pretreatment methods. That is, range scaling and autoscaling were able to remove the dependence of the rank of the metabolites on the average concentration and the magnitude of the fold changes and showed biologically sensible results after PCA (principal component analysis).In conclusion, selecting a proper data pretreatment method is an essential step in the analysis of metabolomics data and greatly affects the metabolites that are identified to be the most important.},

Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations.We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.Additional figures may be found at http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bolstad/normalize/index.html},

NAD(+)-dependent signalling pathways are many and varied, and they regulate fundamental events such as transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and metabolism. Many of these processes have been linked to cancer development. Given that NAD(+)-dependent signalling reactions involve the degradation of the molecule, permanent nucleotide resynthesis through different biosynthetic pathways is crucial for incessant cancer cell proliferation. This necessity supports the targeting of NAD metabolism as a new therapeutic concept for cancer treatment.},

The metabolic analysis of cell cultures has many potential applications and advantages to currently used methods for cell line testing. Metabolite concentrations represent sensitive markers of both genomic and phenotypic changes. Consequently, the development of robust metabolomic platforms will greatly facilitate various applications of cell cultures - including, for example, the understanding of the in vitro and in vivo actions of drugs - and aid in their rapid incorporation into novel therapeutic settings. In addition, metabolomic analysis of cell lines provides information, either independently or in conjunction with other omics measurements, essential for system level analysis and modeling of biological systems. This review outlines some of the applications of metabolomics in cell culture analysis and some of the issues that need to be addressed to make this approach more relevant.},

  Abstract                 = {Sphingomyelin (SM) is a prominent phospholipid component of cell membranes that has evolved diverse functions in cells beyond its role in membrane structural organization. Cleavage of SM by acid or neutral sphingomyelinase results in the liberation of ceramide, an intracellular messenger that regulates the activities of an array of kinases, phosphatases and transcription factors. Signals that activate sphingomyelinases range from growth factors and cytokines, to neurotransmitters, hormones and reactive oxygen species. Studies of experimental cell culture and animal models, and of patients with inherited defects in sphingomyelin metabolism suggest important roles for SM-ceramide signaling in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. At low concentrations SM and ceramide can stimulate cell proliferation and survival, whereas higher levels can induce cell dysfunction or death. Analyses of development and aging suggest a major role for SM metabolism in regulating development rate and lifespan. Several factors that alter the metabolism of sphingolipids, including oxidative and metabolic stress, also increase risk and progression of age-related diseases. In addition, recent findings have linked alterations in SM metabolism to the pathogenesis of several age-related diseases including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. The emerging data suggest the possibility that dietary and pharmacological manipulations of SM metabolism might prove effective in extending lifespan and treating various age-related diseases.},

Here we describe the experimental workflow for long-term and large-scale metabolomic studies involving thousands of human samples with data acquired for multiple analytical batches over many months and years. Protocols for serum- and plasma-based metabolic profiling applying gas chromatography-MS (GC-MS) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography-MS (UPLC-MS) are described. These include biofluid collection, sample preparation, data acquisition, data pre-processing and quality assurance. Methods for quality control-based robust LOESS signal correction to provide signal correction and integration of data from multiple analytical batches are also described. }},

  Abstract                 = {The field of metabolomics is getting more and more popular and a wide range of different sample preparation procedures are in use by different laboratories. Chemical extraction methods using one or more organic solvents as the extraction agent are the most commonly used approach to extract intracellular metabolites and generate metabolite profiles. Metabolite profiles are the scaffold supporting the biological interpretation in metabolomics. Therefore, we aimed to address the following fundamental question: can we obtain similar metabolomic results and, consequently, reach the same biological interpretation by using different protocols for extraction of intracellular metabolites? We have used four different methods for extraction of intracellular metabolites using four different microbial cell types (Gram negative bacterium, Gram positive bacterium, yeast, and a filamentous fungus). All the quenched samples were pooled together before extraction, and, therefore, they were identical. After extraction and GCÃ¢ÂÂMS analysis of metabolites, we did not only detect different numbers of compounds depending on the extraction method used and regardless of the cell type tested, but we also obtained distinct metabolite levels for the compounds commonly detected by all methods (P-value < 0.001). These differences between methods resulted in contradictory biological interpretation regarding the activity of different metabolic pathways. Therefore, our results show that different solvent-based extraction methods can yield significantly different metabolite profiles, which impact substantially in the biological interpretation of metabolomics data. Thus, development of alternative extraction protocols and, most importantly, standardization of sample preparation methods for metabolomics should be seriously pursued by the scientific community.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Data pre-processing is an essential part of chemometric data analysis, which aims to remove unwanted variation (such as instrumental artifacts) and thereby focusing on the variation of interest. The choice of an optimal pre-processing method or combination of methods may strongly influence the analysis results, but is far from straightforward, since it depends on the characteristics of the data set and the goal of data analysis. This first critical review is devoted to the selection procedure for appropriate pre-processing strategies. We show that breaking with current trends in pre-processing is essential, as all selection approaches have serious drawbacks and cannot be properly used.},

It further predicts combinations of synthetic lethal drug targets, whose synergy is validated using available drug efficacy and gene expression measurements across the NCI-60 cancer cell line collection.

  Abstract                 = {Hypoxia is one of the features of poorly vascularised areas of solid tumours but cancer cells can survive in these areas despite the low oxygen tension. The adaptation to hypoxia requires both biochemical and genetic responses that culminate in a metabolic rearrangement to counter-balance the decrease in energy supply from mitochondrial respiration. The understanding of metabolic adaptations under hypoxia could reveal novel pathways that, if targeted, would lead to specific death of hypoxic regions. In this study, we developed biochemical and metabolomic analyses to assess the effects of hypoxia on cellular metabolism of HCT116 cancer cell line. We utilized an oxygen fluorescent probe in anaerobic cuvettes to study oxygen consumption rates under hypoxic conditions without the need to re-oxygenate the cells and demonstrated that hypoxic cells can maintain active, though diminished, oxidative phosphorylation even at 1\% oxygen. These results were further supported by in situ microscopy analysis of mitochondrial NADH oxidation under hypoxia. We then used metabolomic methodologies, utilizing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), to determine the metabolic profile of hypoxic cells. This approach revealed the importance of synchronized and regulated catabolism as a mechanism of adaptation to bioenergetic stress. We then confirmed the presence of autophagy under hypoxic conditions and demonstrated that the inhibition of this catabolic process dramatically reduced the ATP levels in hypoxic cells and stimulated hypoxia-induced cell death. These results suggest that under hypoxia, autophagy is required to support ATP production, in addition to glycolysis, and that the inhibition of autophagy might be used to selectively target hypoxic regions of tumours, the most notoriously resistant areas of solid tumours.},

  Abstract                 = {The field of metabolomics has witnessed an exponential growth in the last decade driven by important applications spanning a wide range of areas in the basic and life sciences and beyond. Mass spectrometry in combination with chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance are the two major analytical avenues for the analysis of metabolic species in complex biological mixtures. Owing to its inherent significantly higher sensitivity and fast data acquisition, MS plays an increasingly dominant role in the metabolomics field. Propelled by the need to develop simple methods to diagnose and manage the numerous and widespread human diseases, mass spectrometry has witnessed tremendous growth with advances in instrumentation, experimental methods, software, and databases. In response, the metabolomics field has moved far beyond qualitative methods and simple pattern recognition approaches to a range of global and targeted quantitative approaches that are now routinely used and provide reliable data, which instill greater confidence in the derived inferences. Powerful isotope labeling and tracing methods have become very popular. The newly emerging ambient ionization techniques such as desorption ionization and rapid evaporative ionization have allowed direct MS analysis in real time, as well as new MS imaging approaches. While the MS-based metabolomics has provided insights into metabolic pathways and fluxes, and metabolite biomarkers associated with numerous diseases, the increasing realization of the extremely high complexity of biological mixtures underscores numerous challenges including unknown metabolite identification, biomarker validation, and interlaboratory reproducibility that need to be dealt with for realization of the full potential of MS-based metabolomics. This chapter provides a glimpse at the current status of the mass spectrometry-based metabolomics field highlighting the opportunities and challenges.},

The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out.

We recently observed specific metabolic patterns in apoptotic cell lines; however, in that study, apoptosis was only induced with one pro-apoptotic agent, staurosporine.The aim of this study was to find novel biomarkers of apoptosis by verifying our previous findings using two further pro-apoptotic agents, 5-fluorouracil and etoposide, that are commonly used in anticancer treatment.Metabolic parameters were assessed in HepG2 and HEK293 cells using the newborn screening assay adapted for cell culture approaches, quantifying the levels of amino acids and acylcarnitines with mass spectrometry.We were able to identify apoptosis-specific changes in the metabolite profile. Moreover, the amino acids alanine and glutamate were both significantly up-regulated in apoptotic HepG2 and HEK293 cells irrespective of the apoptosis inducer.Our observations clearly indicate the potential of metabolomics in detecting metabolic biomarkers applicable in theranostics and for monitoring drug efficacy.},

  Abstract                 = {Many experimentally-derived data sets are generated in the practice of clinical chemistry. Graphical presentation is essential to assess the data distribution. The distribution must also be assessed quantitatively. These approaches will determine if the data is Normal or not. Finally the results of these tests of Normality must be shown to be free of sample size effects.Four experimentally-derived data sets were used. They represented normal, positive kurtotic, positive- and negatively-skewed distributions. These data sets were examined by graphical techniques, by moment tests, by tests of Normality, and monitored for sample size effects.The preferred graphical techniques are the histogram and the box-and-whisker plots that may be supplemented, with advantage, by quantile-quantile or probability-probability plots. Classical tests of skewness and kurtosis can produce conflicting and often confusing results and, as a consequence, the alternative use of the newer L-moments is advocated. Normality tests included the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (Lilliefors modification), Cramér-von Mises and Anderson-Darling tests (empirical distribution function statistics) and the Gan-Koehler, Shapiro-Wilk, Shapiro-Francia, and Filliben tests (regression/correlation techniques). Of these only the Anderson-Darling, Shapiro-Wilk, and Shapiro-Francia tests correctly classified all four test samples. The effect of sample size on the resulting p-value was investigated using Royston's V'/v' graphical test.A systematic approach to Normality testing should follow the route of graphical presentation, the use of L-moments, the use of Anderson-Darling, Shapiro-Wilk, or Shapiro-Francia testing, and Royston's sample size monitoring.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern research in food science and nutrition is moving from classical methodologies to advanced analytical strategies in which MS-based techniques play a crucial role. In this context, Foodomics has been recently defined as a new discipline that studies food and nutrition domains through the application of advanced omics technologies in which MS techniques are considered indispensable. Applications of Foodomics include the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and/or metabolomic study of foods for compound profiling, authenticity, and/or biomarker-detection related to food quality or safety; the development of new transgenic foods, food contaminants, and whole toxicity studies; new investigations on food bioactivity, food effects on human health, etc. This review work does not intend to provide an exhaustive revision of the many works published so far on food analysis using MS techniques. The aim of the present work is to provide an overview of the different MS-based strategies that have been (or can be) applied in the new field of Foodomics, discussing their advantages and drawbacks. Besides, some ideas about the foreseen development and applications of MS-techniques in this new discipline are also provided.},

  Abstract                 = {Because redox-regulated signalling pathways are often modulated by the thiol/disulfide redox state (REDST), changes in plasma \{REDST\} may possibly account for pathological processes. We, therefore, investigated the mechanisms that account for changes in the plasma \{REDST\} as derived in first approximation from the cystine and acid soluble thiol (mainly cysteine) concentrations. Elderly subjects (studies A) and younger subjects after intensive physical exercise (IPE) (study B) i.e. subjects in conditions typically associated with decreased insulin responsiveness, showed, on the average, an increase in the plasma total free amino acid (TAA) concentration to approximately 3000 ÃÂÃÂ¼M, including an increase in cystine but no increase in the thiol concentration if compared with controls. The \{REDST\} was decreased accordingly. A study on the postabsorptive amino acid exchange rates across the lower extremities (study C) indicated that a \{TAA\} level ÃÂ¢ÃÂ©ÃÂ¾2800 ÃÂÃÂ¼M supports a balanced net protein synthesis even under conditions of weak insulin stimulation, suggesting that high \{TAA\} levels may prevent the release of cysteine into the blood in the postabsorptive state. Collectively, these studies indicate that the age-related oxidative shift in plasma \{REDST\} may result from the decrease in amino acid clearance capacity and may be aggravated by excessive physical exercise. },

  Abstract                 = {Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS) has been widely used in proteomics and metabolomics research. In this context, the technology has been increasingly used for differential profiling, i.e. broad screening of biomolecular components across multiple samples in order to elucidate the observed phenotypes and discover biomarkers. One of the major challenges in this domain remains development of better solutions for processing of LC/MS data.We present a software package MZmine that enables differential LC/MS analysis of metabolomics data. This software is a toolbox containing methods for all data processing stages preceding differential analysis: spectral filtering, peak detection, alignment and normalization. Specifically, we developed and implemented a new recursive peak search algorithm and a secondary peak picking method for improving already aligned results, as well as a normalization tool that uses multiple internal standards. Visualization tools enable comparative viewing of data across multiple samples. Peak lists can be exported into other data analysis programs. The toolbox has already been utilized in a wide range of applications. We demonstrate its utility on an example of metabolic profiling of Catharanthus roseus cell cultures.The software is freely available under the GNU General Public License and it can be obtained from the project web page at: http://mzmine.sourceforge.net/.},

  Abstract                 = {There have been considerable improvements in therapeutics for chronic diseases. However, the maximum benefit of these or other options are hard to achieve in practice, due in part to the difficulties associated with determining optimal targets for such interventions. Recent developments have suggested that understanding changes in metabolite profiles will confer a high degree of predictive accuracy in terms of understanding the fundamental mechanisms resulting in perturbations of the metabolic state. Metabolomics involves the establishment of relationships between phenotype and a metabolic signature, which are key aspects of biological function. These approaches have been applied to the identification of serum/plasma metabolic markers involved in obesity, diabetes and vascular disease using animal models or in humans. Different kinds of metabolite profiling techniques using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, ultraperformance liquid chromatography and so on are currently employed to generate global metabolic profiles. Scientific information derived from these techniques can be applied to provide accurate and clinically useful prognostic/diagnostic capability for the management of major chronic diseases. One current consideration limiting the widespread use of metabolomic profiling is the analysis of its cost-effectiveness. In summary, it is hoped that the information derived from metabolite profiling will make it possible to suggest individualized therapies that more effectively treat disease.},

Between and within batch calibration techniques are applied and the analytical error is reduced significantly (increase of 25\% of peaks with RSD lower than 20\%) and does not hamper or interfere with statistical analysis of the final data.},

  Abstract                 = {Metabolomics is a post genomic research field concerned with developing methods for analysis of low molecular weight compounds in biological systems, such as cells, organs or organisms. Analyzing metabolic differences between unperturbed and perturbed systems, such as healthy volunteers and patients with a disease, can lead to insights into the underlying pathology. In metabolomics analysis, large amounts of data are routinely produced in order to characterize samples. The use of multivariate data analysis techniques and chemometrics is a commonly used strategy for obtaining reliable results. Metabolomics have been applied in different fields such as disease diagnosis, toxicology, plant science and pharmaceutical and environmental research. In this review we take a closer look at the chemometric methods used and the available results within the field of disease diagnosis. We will first present some current strategies for performing metabolomics studies, especially regarding disease diagnosis. The main focus will be on data analysis strategies and validation of multivariate models, since there are many pitfalls in this regard. Further, we highlight the most interesting metabolomics publications and discuss these in detail; additional studies are mentioned as a reference for the interested reader. A general trend is an increased focus on biological interpretation rather than merely the ability to classify samples. In the conclusions, the general trends and some recommendations for improving metabolomics data analysis are provided.},

  Abstract                 = {Metabolomics allows the simultaneous and relative quantification of thousands of different metabolites within a given sample using sensitive and specific methodologies such as gas or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, typically in discovery phases of studies. Biomarkers are biological characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biological processes, pathological processes or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers are widely used in clinical practice for the diagnosis, assessment of severity and response to therapy in a number of clinical disease states. In human studies, metabolomics has been applied to define biomarkers related to prognosis or diagnosis of a disease or drug toxicity/efficacy and in doing so hopes to provide greater pathophysiological understanding of disease or therapeutic toxicity/efficacy. This review discusses the application of metabolomics in the discovery and subsequent application of biomarkers in the diagnosis and management of inborn errors of metabolism, cardiovascular disease and cancer. We critically appraise how novel biomarkers discovered through metabolomic analysis may be utilized in future clinical practice by addressing the following three fundamental questions: (1) Can the clinician measure them? (2) Do they add new information? (3) Do they help the clinician to manage patients? Although a number of novel biomarkers have been discovered through metabolomic studies of human diseases in the last decade, none have currently made the transition to routine use in clinical practice. Metabolites identified from these early studies will need to form the basis of larger, prospective, externally validated studies in clinical cohorts for their future use as biomarkers. At this stage, the absolute quantification of these biomarkers will need to be assessed epidemiologically, as will the ultimate deployment in the clinic via routine biochemistry, dip stick or similar rapid at- or near-patient care technologies.},

  Abstract                 = {Metabolomics research, like other disciplines utilizing high-throughput technologies, generates a large amount of data for every sample. Although handling this data is a challenge and one of the biggest bottlenecks of the metabolomics workflow, it is also the clue to accomplish valuable results. This work has been designed to supply methodological data mining guidelines, describing systematically the steps to be followed in metabolomics data exploration. Instrumental raw data refinement in the pre-processing step and assessment of the statistical assumptions in pre-treatment directly affect the results of subsequent univariate and multivariate analyses. A study of aging in a healthy population was selected to represent this data mining process. Multivariate analysis of variance and linear regression methods were used to analyze the metabolic changes underlying aging. Selection of both multivariate methods aims to illustrate the treatment of age from two rather different perspectives, as a categorical variable and a continuous variable.Metabolomics is a discipline involving the analysis of a large amount of data to gather relevant information. Researchers in this field have to overcome the challenges of complex data processing and statistical analysis issues. A wide range of tasks has to be executed, from the minimization of batch-to-batch/systematic variations in pre-processing, to the application of common data analysis techniques relying on statistical assumptions. In this work, a real-data metabolic profiling research on aging was used to illustrate the proposed workflow and suggest a set of guidelines for analyzing metabolomics data.

  Abstract                 = {In humans and animals, individual differences in aging of cognitive functions are classically reported. Some old individuals exhibit performances similar to those of young subjects while others are severely impaired. In senescent animals, we have previously demonstrated a significant correlation between the cognitive performance and the cerebral concentration of a neurosteroid, the pregnenolone sulfate (PREG-S). Neurotransmitter systems modulated by this neurosteroid were unknown until our recent report of an enhancement of acetylcholine (ACh) release in basolateral amygdala, cortex and hippocampus induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intracerebral administrations of PREG-S. Central \{ACh\} neurotransmission is known to be involved in the regulation of memory processes and is affected in normal aging and severely altered in human neurodegenerative pathologies like AlzheimerÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬Ã¢ÂÂ¢s disease. In the central nervous system, \{ACh\} neurotransmission is also involved in the modulation of sleepÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬Ã¢ÂÂwakefulness cycle, and particularly the paradoxical sleep (PS). Relationships between paradoxical sleep and memory are documented in the literature in old animals in which the spatial memory performance positively correlates with the basal amounts of paradoxical sleep. PREG-S infused at the level of \{ACh\} cell bodies (nucleus basalis magnocellularis, NBM, or pedunculopontine nucleus, PPT) increases paradoxical sleep in young animals. Finally, aging related cognitive dysfunctions, particularly those observed in AlzheimerÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬Ã¢ÂÂ¢s disease, have also been related to alterations of mechanisms underlying cerebral plasticity. Amongst these mechanisms, neurogenesis has been extensively studied recently. Our data demonstrate that PREG-S central infusions dramatically increase neurogenesis, this effect could be related to the negative modulator properties of this steroid at the \{GABAA\} receptor level. Taken together these data suggest that neurosteroids can influence cognitive processes, particularly in senescent subjects, through a modulation of \{ACh\} neurotransmission associated with paradoxical sleep modifications; furthermore, our recent data suggest a critical role for neurosteroids in the modulation of cerebral plasticity, mainly on hippocampal neurogenesis. },

  Abstract                 = {A cross-sectional survey was made in 56 exceptionally healthy males, ranging in age from 20 to 84 years. Measurements were made of selected steroidal components and peptidic hormones in blood serum, and cognitive and physical tests were performed. Of those blood serum variables that gave highly significant negative correlations with age (r > ?0.6), bioavailable testosterone (BT), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and the ratio of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) to growth hormone (GH) showed a stepwise pattern of age-related changes most closely resembling those of the age steps themselves. Of these, BT correlated best with significantly age-correlated cognitive and physical measures. Because DHEAS correlated well with BT and considerably less well than BT with the cognitive and physical measures, it seems likely that BT and/or substances to which BT gives rise in tissues play a more direct role in whatever processes are rate-limiting in the functions measured and that DHEAS relates more indirectly to these functions. The high correlation of IGF-1/GH with age, its relatively low correlation with BT, and the patterns of correlations of IGF-1/GH and BT with significantly age-correlated cognitive and physical measures suggest that the GHÃ¢ÂÂIGF-1 axis and BT play independent roles in affecting these functions. Serial determinations made after oral ingestion of pregnenolone and data from the literature suggest there is interdependence of steroid metabolic systems with those operational in control of interrelations in the GHÃ¢ÂÂIGF-1 axis. Longitudinal concurrent measurements of serum levels of BT, DHEAS, and IGF-1/GH together with detailed studies of their correlations with age-correlated functional measures may be useful in detecting early age-related dysregulations and may be helpful in devising ameliorative approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {Epidemiological studies in man and with experimental animal models have shown that intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) resulting in low birth weight is associated with higher risk of programming welfare diseases in later life. In the pig, severe IUGR occurs naturally and contribute substantially to a large intralitter variation in birth weight and may therefore be a good model for man. In the present paper the natural form of IUGR in pigs was studied close to term by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR-)based metabolomics. The NMR-based investigations revealed different metabolic profiles of plasma samples from low-birth weight (LW) and high-birth weight (HW) piglets, respectively, and differences were assigned to levels of glucose and myo-inositol. Further studies by GC-MS revealed that LW piglets had a significant higher concentration of myoinositol and D-chiro-inositol in plasma compared to larger littermates. Myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol have been coupled with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in adults, and the present paper therefore suggests that IUGR is related to impaired glucose metabolism during fetal development, which may cause type 2 diabetes in adulthood.},

With >25,000 compounds known in various foods, the food metabolome is extremely complex, with a composition varying widely according to the diet. By its very nature it represents a considerable and still largely unexploited source of novel dietary biomarkers that could be used to measure dietary exposures with a high level of detail and precision. Most dietary biomarkers currently have been identified on the basis of our knowledge of food compositions by using hypothesis-driven approaches. However, the rapid development of metabolomics resulting from the development of highly sensitive modern analytic instruments, the availability of metabolite databases, and progress in (bio)informatics has made agnostic approaches more attractive as shown by the recent identification of novel biomarkers of intakes for fruit, vegetables, beverages, meats, or complex diets. Moreover, examples also show how the scrutiny of the food metabolome can lead to the discovery of bioactive molecules and dietary factors associated with diseases. However, researchers still face hurdles, which slow progress and need to be resolved to bring this emerging field of research to maturity. These limits were discussed during the First International Workshop on the Food Metabolome held in Glasgow. Key recommendations made during the workshop included more coordination of efforts; development of new databases, software tools, and chemical libraries for the food metabolome; and shared repositories of metabolomic data. Once achieved, major progress can be expected toward a better understanding of the complex interactions between diet and human health.},

The mapping of structural components and their relation to cell activation as well as generation of potent lipid mediators and networks involves a mass spectrometry-computational approach to appreciate inter-relationships and complex mediator networks important for cell homeostasis. Cell membranes are composed of a bilayer that contains phospholipids, fatty acids, integral membrane proteins, and membrane associated proteins, sphingolipids, etc. Membrane composition of many cell types is established. However, their organization and how they affect cell function remains an area of interest and a quest for lipidomics. Membranes serve barrier functions separating the inside from outside or compartments within cells, regulating passage of nutrients, gasses, and specific ions as well as generate signals to the intracellular milieu by the membrane's ability to interact with key proteins. The nature of these interactions and decoding the structure-function information within their organization is the promise of lipidomics (A-C). Metabolism of fatty acids is also an important energy source; hence, catabolism breakdown of fatty acids, areas of metabolomics that link to the signaling pathways, and roles of lipid mediators discussed herein.},

  Abstract                 = {Tumor grading is very important both in treatment decision and evaluation of prognosis. While tissue samples are obtained as part of most therapeutic approaches, factors that may result in inaccurate grading due to sampling error (namely, heterogeneity in tissue sampling, as well as tumor-grade heterogeneity within the same tumor specimen), have led to a desire to use imaging better to ascertain tumor grade. The purpose in our study was to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), area under the curve (AUC), and accuracy of diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI), proton MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) or both in grading primary cerebral gliomas.We performed conventional MR imaging (MR), DWI, and MRSI in 74 patients with newly diagnosed brain gliomas: 59 patients had histologically verified high-grade gliomas: 37 glioblastomas multiform (GBM) and 22 anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), and 15 patients had low-grade gliomas. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of tumor and peritumoral edema, and ADC ratios (ADC in tumor or peritumoral edema to ADC of contralateral white matter, as well as ADC in tumor to ADC in peritumoral edema) were determined from three regions of interest. The average of the mean, maximum, and minimum for ADC variables was calculated for each patient. The metabolite ratios of Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA at intermediate TE were assessed from spectral maps in the solid portion of tumor, peritumoral edema and contralateral normal-appearing white matter. Tumor grade determined with the two methods was then compared with that from histopathologic grading. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to determine optimum thresholds for tumor grading. Measures of diagnostic examination performance, such as sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, AUC, and accuracy for identifying high-grade gliomas were also calculated.Statistical analysis demonstrated a threshold minimum ADC tumor value of 1.07 to provide sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 79.7\%, 60.0\%, 88.7\%, and 42.9\% respectively, in determining high-grade gliomas. Threshold values of 1.35 and 1.78 for peritumoral Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA metabolite ratios resulted in sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 83.3\%, 85.1\%, 41.7\%, 97.6\%, and 100\%, 57.4\%, 23.1\% and 100\% respectively for determining high-grade gliomas. Significant differences were noted in the ADC tumor values and ratios, peritumoral Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA metabolite ratios, and tumoral Cho/NAA ratio between low- and high-grade gliomas. The combination of mean ADC tumor value, maximum ADC tumor ratio, peritumoral Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA metabolite ratios resulted in sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 91.5\%, 100\%, 100\% and 60\% respectively.Combining DWI and MRSI increases the accuracy of preoperative imaging in the determination of glioma grade. MRSI had superior diagnostic performance in predicting glioma grade compared with DWI alone. The predictive values are helpful in the clinical decision-making process to evaluate the histologic grade of tumors, and provide a means of guiding treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {Metabolomics is the discipline where endogenous and exogenous metabolites are assessed, identified and quantified in different biological samples. Metabolites are crucial components of biological system and highly informative about its functional state, due to their closeness to functional endpoints and to the organism's phenotypes. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, next to Mass Spectrometry (MS), is one of the main metabolomics analytical platforms. The technological developments in the field of NMR spectroscopy have enabled the identification and quantitative measurement of the many metabolites in a single sample of biofluids in a non-targeted and non-destructive manner. Combination of NMR spectra of biofluids and pattern recognition methods has driven forward the application of metabolomics in the field of biomarker discovery. The importance of metabolomics in diagnostics, e.g. in identifying biomarkers or defining pathological status, has been growing exponentially as evidenced by the number of published papers.

  Abstract                 = {Hydrophilic interaction ultra performance liquid chromatography (HILIC-UPLC) permits the analysis of highly polar metabolites, providing complementary information to reversed-phase (RP) chromatography. HILIC-UPLC-TOF-MS was investigated for the global metabolic profiling of rat urine samples generated in an experimental hepatotoxicity study of galactosamine (galN) and the concomitant investigation of the protective effect of glycine. Within-run repeatability and stability over a large sample batch (>200 samples, 60 h run-time) was assessed through the repeat analysis of a quality control sample. Following system equilibration, excellent repeatability was observed in terms of retention time (CV < 1.7\%), signal intensity (CV < 14\%), and mass variability (<0.005 amu), providing a good measure of reproducibility. Classification of urinary metabolic profiles according to treatment was observed, with significant changes in specific metabolites after galN exposure, including increased urocanic acid, N-acetylglucosamine, and decreased 2-oxoglutarate. A novel finding from this HILIC-UPLC-MS approach was elevated urinary tyramine in galN-treated rats, reflecting disturbed amino acid metabolism. These results show HILIC-UPLC-MS to be a promising method for global metabolic profiling, demonstrating high within-run repeatability, even over an extended run time. Retention of polar endogenous analytes and xenobiotic metabolites was improved compared with RP studies, including galN, N-acetylglucosamine, oxoglutarate, and urocanic acid, enhancing metabolome coverage and potentially improving biomarker discovery.},

Either individually or grouped as a metabolomic profile, detection of metabolites is carried out in cells, tissues, or biofluids by either nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. There is potential for the metabolome to have a multitude of uses in oncology, including the early detection and diagnosis of cancer and as both a predictive and pharmacodynamic marker of drug effect. Despite this, there is lack of knowledge in the oncology community regarding metabolomics and confusion about its methodologic processes, technical challenges, and clinical applications. Metabolomics, when used as a translational research tool, can provide a link between the laboratory and clinic, particularly because metabolic and molecular imaging technologies, such as positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, enable the discrimination of metabolic markers noninvasively in vivo. Here, we review the current and potential applications of metabolomics, focusing on its use as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic evaluation.},

  Abstract                 = {Biological systems are increasingly being studied in a holistic manner, using omics approaches, to provide quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the diverse collection of cellular components. Among the omics approaches, metabolomics, which deals with the quantitative global profiling of small molecules or metabolites, is being used extensively to explore the dynamic response of living systems, such as organelles, cells, tissues, organs and whole organisms, under diverse physiological and pathological conditions. This technology is now used routinely in a number of applications, including basic and clinical research, agriculture, microbiology, food science, nutrition, pharmaceutical research, environmental science and the development of biofuels. Of the multiple analytical platforms available to perform such analyses, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry have come to dominate, owing to the high resolution and large datasets that can be generated with these techniques. The large multidimensional datasets that result from such studies must be processed and analyzed to render this data meaningful. Thus, bioinformatics tools are essential for the efficient processing of huge datasets, the characterization of the detected signals, and to align multiple datasets and their features. This paper provides a state-of-the-art overview of the data processing tools available, and reviews a collection of recent reports on the topic. Data conversion, pre-processing, alignment, normalization and statistical analysis are introduced, with their advantages and disadvantages, and comparisons are made to guide the reader.},

However, no single analytic technique covers the entire spectrum of the human metabolome. Here we present results from a multiplatform study, in which we investigate what kind of results can presently be obtained in the field of diabetes research when combining metabolomics data collected on a complementary set of analytical platforms in the framework of an epidemiological study.40 individuals with self-reported diabetes and 60 controls (male, over 54 years) were randomly selected from the participants of the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) study, representing an extensively phenotyped sample of the general German population. Concentrations of over 420 unique small molecules were determined in overnight-fasting blood using three different techniques, covering nuclear magnetic resonance and tandem mass spectrometry. Known biomarkers of diabetes could be replicated by this multiple metabolomic platform approach, including sugar metabolites (1,5-anhydroglucoitol), ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate), and branched chain amino acids. In some cases, diabetes-related medication can be detected (pioglitazone, salicylic acid).Our study depicts the promising potential of metabolomics in diabetes research by identification of a series of known and also novel, deregulated metabolites that associate with diabetes. Key observations include perturbations of metabolic pathways linked to kidney dysfunction (3-indoxyl sulfate), lipid metabolism (glycerophospholipids, free fatty acids), and interaction with the gut microflora (bile acids). Our study suggests that metabolic markers hold the potential to detect diabetes-related complications already under sub-clinical conditions in the general population.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a general consensus that supports the need for standardized reporting of metadata or information describing large-scale metabolomics and other functional genomics data sets. Reporting of standard metadata provides a biological and empirical context for the data, facilitates experimental replication, and enables the re-interrogation and comparison of data by others. Accordingly, the Metabolomics Standards Initiative is building a general consensus concerning the minimum reporting standards for metabolomics experiments of which the Chemical Analysis Working Group (CAWG) is a member of this community effort. This article proposes the minimum reporting standards related to the chemical analysis aspects of metabolomics experiments including: sample preparation, experimental analysis, quality control, metabolite identification, and data pre-processing. These minimum standards currently focus mostly upon mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy due to the popularity of these techniques in metabolomics.

  Abstract                 = {The pathophysiological changes associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) begin decades before the emergence of clinical symptoms. Understanding the early mechanisms associated with AD pathology is, therefore, especially important for identifying disease-modifying therapeutic targets. While the majority of AD clinical trials to date have focused on anti-amyloid-beta (A?) treatments, other therapeutic approaches may be necessary. The ability to monitor changes in cellular networks that include both A? and non-A? pathways is essential to advance our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of AD and subsequent development of cognitive symptoms and dementia. Metabolomics is a powerful tool that detects perturbations in the metabolome, a pool of metabolites that reflects changes downstream of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic fluctuations, and represents an accurate biochemical profile of the organism in health and disease. The application of metabolomics could help to identify biomarkers for early AD diagnosis, to discover novel therapeutic targets, and to monitor therapeutic response and disease progression. Moreover, given the considerable parallel between mouse and human metabolism, the use of metabolomics provides ready translation of animal research into human studies for accelerated drug design. In this review, we will summarize current progress in the application of metabolomics in both animal models and in humans to further understanding of the mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis.

  Abstract                 = {There is a need for more efficient methods giving insight into the complex mechanisms of neurotoxicity. Testing strategies including in vitro methods have been proposed to comply with this requirement. With the present study we aimed to develop a novel in vitro approach which mimics in vivo complexity, detects neurotoxicity comprehensively, and provides mechanistic insight. For this purpose we combined rat primary re-aggregating brain cell cultures with a mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics approach. For the proof of principle we treated developing re-aggregating brain cell cultures for 48 h with the neurotoxicant methyl mercury chloride (0.1-100 microM) and the brain stimulant caffeine (1-100 microM) and acquired cellular metabolic profiles. To detect toxicant-induced metabolic alterations the profiles were analysed using commercial software which revealed patterns in the multi-parametric dataset by principal component analyses (PCA), and recognised the most significantly altered metabolites. PCA revealed concentration-dependent cluster formations for methyl mercury chloride (0.1-1 microM), and treatment-dependent cluster formations for caffeine (1-100 microM) at sub-cytotoxic concentrations. Four relevant metabolites responsible for the concentration-dependent alterations following methyl mercury chloride treatment could be identified using MS-MS fragmentation analysis. These were gamma-aminobutyric acid, choline, glutamine, creatine and spermine. Their respective mass ion intensities demonstrated metabolic alterations in line with the literature and suggest that the metabolites could be biomarkers for mechanisms of neurotoxicity or neuroprotection. In addition, we evaluated whether the approach could identify neurotoxic potential by testing eight compounds which have target organ toxicity in the liver, kidney or brain at sub-cytotoxic concentrations. PCA revealed cluster formations largely dependent on target organ toxicity indicating possible potential for the development of a neurotoxicity prediction model. With such results it could be useful to perform a validation study to determine the reliability, relevance and applicability of this approach to neurotoxicity screening. Thus, for the first time we show the benefits and utility of in vitro metabolomics to comprehensively detect neurotoxicity and to discover new biomarkers.},

We investigated whether metabolite profiles could predict the development of diabetes. Among 2,422 normoglycemic individuals followed for 12 years, 201 developed diabetes. Amino acids, amines and other polar metabolites were profiled in baseline specimens by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cases and controls were matched for age, body mass index and fasting glucose. Five branched-chain and aromatic amino acids had highly significant associations with future diabetes: isoleucine, leucine, valine, tyrosine and phenylalanine. A combination of three amino acids predicted future diabetes (with a more than fivefold higher risk for individuals in top quartile). The results were replicated in an independent, prospective cohort. These findings underscore the potential key role of amino acid metabolism early in the pathogenesis of diabetes and suggest that amino acid profiles could aid in diabetes risk assessment.},

Separation methods such as ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) in combination with MS are needed to obtain sufficient resolution to create diagnostic metabolic profiles and identify candidate biomarkers. We provide detailed protocols for sample preparation, chromatographic procedures, multivariate analysis and metabolite identification via tandem MS (MS/MS) techniques and high-resolution MS. By using these optimized approaches, analysis of a set of samples using a 96-well plate format would take ?48 h: 1 h for system setup, 8-10 h for sample preparation, 34 h for UPLC-MS analysis and 2-3 h for preliminary/exploratory data processing, representing a robust method for untargeted metabolic screening of tissue samples.},

  Abstract                 = {Metabolomics is increasingly being applied towards the identification of biomarkers for disease diagnosis, prognosis and risk prediction. Unfortunately among the many published metabolomic studies focusing on biomarker discovery, there is very little consistency and relatively little rigor in how researchers select, assess or report their candidate biomarkers. In particular, few studies report any measure of sensitivity, specificity, or provide receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves with associated confidence intervals. Even fewer studies explicitly describe or release the biomarker model used to generate their ROC curves. This is surprising given that for biomarker studies in most other biomedical fields, ROC curve analysis is generally considered the standard method for performance assessment. Because the ultimate goal of biomarker discovery is the translation of those biomarkers to clinical practice, it is clear that the metabolomics community needs to start "speaking the same language" in terms of biomarker analysis and reporting-especially if it wants to see metabolite markers being routinely used in the clinic. In this tutorial, we will first introduce the concept of ROC curves and describe their use in single biomarker analysis for clinical chemistry. This includes the construction of ROC curves, understanding the meaning of area under ROC curves (AUC) and partial AUC, as well as the calculation of confidence intervals. The second part of the tutorial focuses on biomarker analyses within the context of metabolomics. This section describes different statistical and machine learning strategies that can be used to create multi-metabolite biomarker models and explains how these models can be assessed using ROC curves. In the third part of the tutorial we discuss common issues and potential pitfalls associated with different analysis methods and provide readers with a list of nine recommendations for biomarker analysis and reporting. To help readers test, visualize and explore the concepts presented in this tutorial, we also introduce a web-based tool called ROCCET (ROC Curve Explorer & Tester, http://www.roccet.ca). ROCCET was originally developed as a teaching aid but it can also serve as a training and testing resource to assist metabolomics researchers build biomarker models and conduct a range of common ROC curve analyses for biomarker studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Metabolomics research, as other disciplines utilizing high-throughput technologies, generates a large amount of data for every sample. Although handling this data is a challenge and one of the biggest bottlenecks of the metabolomics workflow, it is also the clue to accomplish valuable results. This work has been designed to supply methodological data mining guidelines, describing systematically the steps to be followed in metabolomics data exploration. Instrumental raw data refinement in the pre-processing step and assessment of the statistical assumptions in pre-treatment directly affect the results of subsequent univariate and multivariate analyses. A study of aging in a healthy population was selected to represent this data mining process. Multivariate analysis of variance and linear regression methods were used to analyze the metabolic changes underlying aging. Selection of both multivariate methods aims to illustrate the treatment of age from two rather different perspectives, as categorical and continuous variable. Biological significance Metabolomics is a discipline involving the analysis of a large amount of data to gather the relevant information. Researchers in this field have to overcome the challenges of complex data processing and statistical analysis issues. A wide range of tasks has to be executed, from the minimization of batch-to-batch/systematic variations in pre-processing, to the application of common data analysis techniques relying on statistical assumptions. In this work, a real-data metabolic profiling research on aging was used to illustrate the proposed workflow and suggest a set of guidelines for analyzing metabolomics data.

	abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent and being overweight is a significant risk factor. The aim was to build an algorithm along with a scoring system for histopathologic classification of liver lesions that covers the entire spectrum of lesions in morbidly obese patients. A cohort of 679 obese patients undergoing liver biopsy at the time of bariatric surgery was studied. An algorithm for segregating lesions into normal liver, NAFLD, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was built based on semiquantitative evaluation of steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning, and lobular inflammation. For each case, the SAF score was created including the semiquantitative scoring of steatosis (S), activity (A), and fibrosis (F). Based on the algorithm, 230 obese patients (34\%) were categorized as NASH, 291 (43\%) as NAFLD without NASH, and 158 (23\%) as not NAFLD. The activity score (ballooning + lobular inflammation) enabled discriminating NASH because all patients with NASH had A ≥ 2, whereas no patients with A {\textless} 2 had NASH. This score was closely correlated with both alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P {\textless} 0.0001, analysis of variance [ANOVA]). Comparison of transaminase levels between patients with normal liver and pure steatosis did not reveal significant differences, thus lending support to the proposal not to include steatosis in the activity score but to report it separately in the SAF score. In the validation series, the interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of NASH was excellent (κ = 0.80) between liver pathologists. There was no discrepancy between the initial diagnosis and the diagnosis proposed using the algorithm.
CONCLUSION: We propose a simple but robust algorithm for categorizing liver lesions in NAFLD patients. Because liver lesions in obese patients may display a continuous spectrum of histologic lesions, we suggest describing liver lesions using the SAF score.},
